This project was inspired by a game Jaeheon Jeong who has a cool youtube channel called JayJeongEdits showed me in class and I recreated it with my own skills but mostly AI and then I invited Jay but he hasn't done anything yet and James is looking at the code on the computer next to me and making the programs better. Hi James if you are looking at this ðŸ‘‹ and then 1orenzo added this really cool stick figure but James doesn't like it because he's jealous 1orenzo has more controbutions than him so he tried to delete it but it was so cool it wasnt deleted.
What if this whole project isn't real and it's just a way to grind contributions while looking smart? Hmmm...


Todolist:
- So uhh we gotta add some sort of timer to make it an actual game
- We should consider this but maybe there could be a thingy so that it is multiple letters each round like in actual Kkutu
- Frenchy got some cool ChatGPT stuff he's bout to add in
